            <p>
              <u>Synopsis</u>:From Jnnifer Weiner comes a story of two sisters
              with nothing in common but a love for shoes learn they
            </p>
            <p>are more alike than they thought possible</p>

            <p>
              Meet Rose Feller, a thirty-year-old high-powered attorney with a
              secret passion for romance novels. She has an
            </p>
            <p>
              exercise regime she'sgoing to start next week, and she dreams of a
              man who will slide off her glasses, gaze into her
            </p>
            <p>
              eye, and tell her she's beautiful. She also dreams of getting her
              fantastically screwed-up, semi-employeed little
            </p>
            <p>to staighten up and fly right</p>

            <p>
              Meet Rose's sister, Maggie. Twenty-eight years old and drop-dead
              gorgeous. Although her big-screen stardom hasn't
            </p>
            <p>
              progressed past her left hip's appearance in a Will Smith video,
              Maggie dreams of fame and fortune -- and of getting
            </p>
            <p>her big sister on a skin-care regimen</p>

            <p>
              These two women, who claim to have nothing in common but a
              childhood tragedy, DNA, and the same size feet, are
            </p>
            <p>
              about to learn that they're more aline than they'd ever imagined.
              Along the way, they'll encounter a diverse cast of
            </p>
            <p>
              characters -- from a stepmother who's into recreational Botox to a
              disdainful pug with no name. They'll borrow shoes
            </p>
            <p>
              and clothers and boyfriends, and eventually make peace with their
              most intimate enemies -- each other.
